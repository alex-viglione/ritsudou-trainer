# 律動 ritsudou-trainer

> A simple rhythm trainer &amp; practice journal. <br>
> Made it mostly because I wanted a simple app to practice with, instead of using pen and paper. How _modern_.


## Features

- ~~Instantly makes you into a japanophile~~
- Your usual metronome
- Trainer with timer
- Practice journal, to record your results and set objectives
- Completely personal

## Important notes
- For now will probably just store results and user data in localStorage, could probably provide a way to download the data (.json comes to mind) and restore it if localStorage gets erased.
